      <p className="bio-paragraph">The better part of valour is discretion. But for this lord Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself, Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude.  To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to  whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.  Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.</p>
